## Overview

In traditional commodity markets, transactions often require intermediaries, banks, and clearinghouses to facilitate trust between parties. This adds unnecessary cost and complexity. Trade Bridge eliminates the need for intermediaries by leveraging blockchain technology to provide a decentralized, transparent, and secure marketplace.

---

## Problems

- **Centralized Control**  
  Most existing platforms are centralized, giving operators significant control over transaction rules, fees, and dispute resolution. This can lead to unfair practices or biased outcomes.

- **Ownership and Authenticity**  
  Proving ownership post-transaction is often difficult. Buyers lack a reliable way to verify or showcase ownership, which leads to issues with authenticity and counterfeit products.

- **Inefficient Dispute Resolution**  
  Disputes in traditional platforms are often resolved slowly and opaquely, with final decisions made without full transparency.

---

## Solutions

- **Blockchain-based Trust**  
  Transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, providing full transparency and accountability between buyers and sellers.

- **Decentralized Marketplace**  
  No central authority. Users maintain full control over their transactions and data. Sellers define their own rules, fees, and terms.

- **NFT Proof of Ownership**  
  Upon successful purchase, buyers receive an NFT representing ownership of the commodity, solving authenticity and tracking issues.

- **Transparent Dispute Resolution**  
  When a dispute is raised, funds are temporarily held in the smart contract. Once resolved, assets are transferred to the rightful party.
